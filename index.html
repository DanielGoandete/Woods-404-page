                    <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming</p> 
                    <p></p> that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.</p> 
                    <p></p>JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled,
                    <p></p> and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax,
                    <p></p> dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>
